GhostPlacer

- Mode 1 (Place when holding item)
  - Options:
    - Auto rotate
    - Auto move

- Mode 2 (Place under mouse)
  - Option to only work with left click down

Options for both

- Can place object if no ghost - i.e. can place object on empty space on ground
- Work for swapping buildings / upgrades
- Work for modules

Notes:

- Check what happens normally when trying to place object on the ground but there are items on the floor - should work in the same way
- Needs to work for tile ghosts as well as normal ghosts
- Needs to work for building swaps / module places
- Needs to respect distance (i.e., work with long and far reach and probably others)
- TODO Add some gifs of it working in
